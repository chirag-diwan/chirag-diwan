# Hey, I'm Chirag Diwan

I build things that are practical, minimal, and scalable.  
Primarily focused on systems that involve collaboration, data synchronization, and clean UI interactions.

---

### What I care about
- Clean and predictable system design
- Transparent team contribution dynamics
- UI that *feels* smooth (animation without visual clutter)
- Code that explains itself

---

### My Development Principles
- *Clarity > Cleverness*
- *Small, composable abstractions*
- *Correctness before optimization*
- *Direct communication — no sugarcoating*

---

### Outside Code
- Gym & high protein diet (consistency matters more than motivation)
- Chess (around 900, Queen’s Pawn enjoyer — play for structure, not tricks)
- Volleyball occasionally

### Contact / Collaboration
If you're building something worth discussing — reach out.
